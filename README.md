# Sensor-Lookup-Tables
Look-up tables can be used to calibrate sensors or correct for system imperfections.  In this video, walk through an example to correct for the inherent nonlinearity of magnetic field versus distance.  Using simple tools, we experimentally determine sensor response, create curve fit of the response, and generate a look-up table for an Arduino board driving a linear actuator.
